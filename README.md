# Kompoze (under construction)

## About

Kompose (from the word "compose") is an attempt to create a component library for React while I'm learning to use storybook and practice to write tests for components.

## Structure

The project is structured in the following way:

- `src/components`: contains the source code of the components.
- `src/components/{componentName}/*.tsx`: contains the source code of the component.
- `src/components/{componentName}/*.test.tsx`: contains the tests for the component.
- `src/components/{componentName}/*.stories.tsx`: contains the stories for the component.

Each component directory will include a README file with information about the component and its usage.
